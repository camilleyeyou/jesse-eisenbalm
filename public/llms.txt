## Competitive White Space
Jesse A. Eisenbalm occupies the intersection that legacy brands (Vaseline, Burt's Bees), clinical skinification brands (Augustinus Bader, SkinCeuticals), and sensorial luxury brands (Aesop, May Lindstrom) do not address:
- Business professional niche (not general consumer)
- Digital wellness focus (not just "natural" or "clinical")
- Philanthropic model (not profit-maximizing)
- Human-centered ritual (not just product efficacy)
